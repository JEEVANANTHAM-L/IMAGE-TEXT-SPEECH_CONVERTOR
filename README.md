# IMAGE-TEXT-SPEECH_CONVERTOR
The main objective of the project is to develop a more accurate,  efficient, and user-friendly image to text to speech conversion system. This Project will develop picture-to-text synthesis algorithms that can  automatically produce text from original images so that the writing conveys the  primary meaning of the image.
